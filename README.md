# Superstore Sales Performance Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data from a fictional Superstore using SQL for data preparation and Power BI for interactive dashboarding. It highlights key metrics such as total sales, profit trends, regional performance, and discount impacts.

## Project Overview  
Retail businesses like Superstore deal with tons of transactional data, but unlocking insights from that data can be a little tricky without a structured approach. Many companies have historical sales records, but they often find it difficult to spot trends, identify best-selling products or regions, and measure how discounts affect their bottom line. Without a centralized performance dashboard, making the best decisions about pricing, inventory, and marketing can be difficult. That's where this project comes in! I used SQL to organize and explore the data, and with Power BI, I created interactive dashboards that provide clear, actionable insights to help drive smart decisions.

## Dataset
